Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews üé¨
This project is an end-to-end Python application that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses a classic machine learning model trained on the popular IMDB dataset to classify text as either positive or negative.

The core of the application is a Logistic Regression model, which provides a robust and interpretable solution for text classification. The project is designed as an interactive command-line tool, allowing users to get instant sentiment predictions for their own reviews.

‚ú® Key Features
Sentiment Classification: A machine learning model trained on over 10,000 movie reviews to predict sentiment with high accuracy.

Interactive Console UI: A user-friendly command-line interface to analyze any movie review you provide in real-time.

Text Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes functions for cleaning raw text data by removing noise like HTML tags and punctuation.

TF-IDF Feature Extraction: Implements the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique to convert text into meaningful numerical features for the model.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, LogisticRegression)
